# What Does All This Mean?

The belief is that PR-STV works exceptionally well in terms of elected bodies being representative of the electorate in terms of geography, ideology and demography. However, adding up the numbers from the last two Irish general elections suggests that, whatever about the theory, PR-STV is a first-past-the-post system in all but name.

It is interesting to note that only two countries use PR-STV to elect governments. It's used in Ireland, it's used in Malta. This means one of three things. Either

1. Certain circumstances exist, circumstances that are common to Malta and Ireland but to no-where else in the world, that make the current system ideal to these two countries and to no other;
2. Ireland and Malta are more advanced democracies than all other democracies in the world, or
3. The Irish and the Maltese are backing the wrong horse.

So what to do? Stick, or twist?

### The Case for the Current System

There are three main arguments in favour of the current system.

1. The electoral system has stood the state well over the hundred years of its existence. It isn't broken, so why fix it?
2. The multi-seat nature of the constituencies means that small parties and areas far from the centre of power have a voice in parliament.
3. Every vote counts. The thrilling nature of the counts at Irish elections, as candidates bubble up through the counts to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, shows that every vote counts.

### The Case Against the Current System

There are refutations for the three arguments in favour, of course, but there are also three separate arguments against PR-STV itself. Not PR-STV in theory, where it's the best electoral system of any, but in the reality in which citizens live and die, and where the conditions of those lives are affected by those politicians elected to govern them. The arguments against PR-STV as it exists in Ireland are these.

1. PR-STV voting encourages clientelism and parish-pump politics, where the local is prioritised at the expense of the national.
2. Ireland is not a big enough country, in terms of population and / or geography, for local issues to tilt national decisions to the extent that they do.
3. The data shows that every vote does not count. The evidence of the past two general elections (2020 and 2016) shows that Ireland's PR-STV electoral system is a first-past-the-post system for nine out of ten Teachtaí Dhála elected.

## Alternatives to PR-STV

Whenever doubts are raised about the suitability of PR-STV as an electoral system, proponents of the status quo always insist that PR-STV is better than the first-past-the-post system used in the UK. This is correct. What is not correct is to posit an either/or argument. That if PR-STV is done away with, first-past-the-post is the only alternative. There are many alternatives that retain the proportionality of PR-STV, but do away with the tempations of clientelism.

## The Purpose of an Electoral System

The [ACE Project Network](https://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/es/explore_topic_new), a think-tank on the nature of elections and the best way to hold them, has some excellent advice on what should be considered when designing an electoral system. They suggest that making a list of desirable outcomes from an electoral system is less important than making a list of catastrophes to be avoided at all costs. This is because electoral systems are important and, if they cannot withstand pressure, everybody suffers as a consequence.

Broadly speaking, a good electoral system should:

- Be representative of the electorate in terms of geography, ideology and demography;
- Facilitate stable and efficient government;
- Encourage Conciliation;
- Encourage Political Parties;
- Hold the government accountable;
- Hold individual elected representatives accountable, and
- Promote legislative accountability and oversight.

Not all of these aims can be achieved, and some are in competition with each other. Where a country is in its history is important also. For instance, the needs of a country that has just emerged from a period of colonial rule would be different to those of a country with a long-standing democratic tradition.

Geography shouldn't be that important in a small nation like the Republic of Ireland. However, geography would be hugely important in a United Ireland as a way will have to be found to knit the two traditions of the island together.

## Two Immediate Challenges

There are, I would suggest, two immediate questions to answer regarding the suitability of PR-STV to Ireland, one quarter of the way into the 21st Century.

1. Does a system that was built in the aftermath of a civil war to service a poor agrarian economy suit the wealthy and progressive country that Ireland has become, with an open economy that is hugely, if not completely, reliant on foreign direct investment?
2. Will that system be able to deal with the changes necessary should Ireland be united?

There is a reluctance among some politicians to discuss or contemplate the second question. It is similar to the reluctance to discuss climate change. Politicians may not like it, but it is very real and preparations have to be made, for good or ill.

## Thank You

I've been obsessing over elections for as long as I can remember, but I only started to get into them on the data side in recent years. The leading light in putting this sort of thing online and accessible to all is [Gavan Reilly of Today FM](https://twitter.com/gavreilly), and he was kind enough to permit me to use all the data he himself had studiously collected. It is to my own shame that the data was officially published on the Open Data Portal before I could use Gavan's. That said, I do remember the kindness, and acknowledge it greatly.
